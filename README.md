**The Problem**

Current data crowdsourcing platforms doesn't allow collection and distribution of secret data for training AI models like medical, financial, family and more. And also has issues like data ownership, trust and payments.



**How It Works**
1. Data collection campaigns are created and the budget is deposited to smart contract
2. Data submitter can select a campaign to submit data 
3. Data submit store the secret data as secret on EduChain and submit the secret to campaign.
4. The campaign creator will validate the data by running blind validation 
5. After data is validated the payments are made to participants 
6. The validated data can be used to train models or do computation through blind computation
